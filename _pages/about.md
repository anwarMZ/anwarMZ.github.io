About me
======
I am a Postdocdoctoral Researcher at the [Center for Infectious Disease Genomics and One Health (CIDGOH)](https://cidgoh.ca), led by Dr. William Hsiao and based at the Faculty of Health Sciences, [Simon Fraser University](https://sfu.ca) in BC, Canada. I study infectious diseases using cutting edge genomics methods and develop bioinformatics workflows to analyze the genomics data at scale. I am member of several multi-disciplionary large scale projects that foster collaborations between acamedics from diverse backgrounds and/or public health practioners. 

I have been a part of two pan-canadian projects that were initiated as a response to COVID-19 pandemic, [Canadian COVID-19 Genomics Network (CanCOGeN-V)](https://virusseq.ca/) & [CoronaVirus Variants Rapid Response Network (CoVaRR-Net)](https://covarrnet.ca/computational-analysis-modelling-and-evolutionary-outcomes-cameo/). I have led the development of [VIRUS-MVP ](virusmvp.org) framework which provides an interactive framework to study the evolving mutaional landscape of SARS-CoV-2, mpox and Influenza in Canada. Please see the projects page for details on all the projects I am leading or contributing to. 

Before joinging CIDGOH, I did my Ph.D. in Prof. Carsten Suhr Jacobsen's group based at the [Department of Environmental Science, Aarhus University](https://envs.au.dk), Denmark. As a Marie Curie Ph.D. fellow, I was part of the MicroArctic project, where I developed and deployed my bioinformatics skills to study the impact of microbes of warming of the Arctic and vice-versa. I used the multi-omics methods to the study the complex microorganisms from different sites e.g., permafrost & glaciers.
